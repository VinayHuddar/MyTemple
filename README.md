# MyTemple

This repo is a codebase of an Android App that I developed for onboarding/signing-up temples and temple committees to a common mobile platform for giving them a global reach, enabling them to provide remote Pooja services to devotees across the world and facilitating donation collections for the betterment of the temple and the society.

The App was called MyTemple and the screenshots are in a default Wiki page. Browse to the "Wiki" tab in the tabs bar above.
